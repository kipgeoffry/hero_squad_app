## Description of Project

The Superhero Squad Builder is a Java Spark application that allows users to assemble well-balanced teams of superheroes. Users can create Hero objects, each having a name, age, special power, and weakness. Special powers and weaknesses can be freely assigned or chosen from a predefined set.

Users can also create Squad objects with customizable attributes, including the maximum squad size, squad name, and the cause they're dedicated to fighting. For example, squads can be formed to combat issues like sexism, computer illiteracy, or even trivial matters like not covering your mouth when you sneeze.

The application allows users to assign heroes to squads, with each hero limited to participating in one squad at a time. You can get creative with your squads and heroes, adding additional features like skill scoring, turn-based battles, and more to enhance the gameplay experience.
